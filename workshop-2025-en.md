The PhD School theme is "Exact methods for vehicle routing and logistics optimisation".
The professor is Roberto Roberti (University of Padua), one of the world's leading experts in vehicle routing and combinatorial optimisation.
Roberto's work has had a tremendous impact on recent advances in exact algorithms for routing problems with fundamental contributions, such as the ng-path relaxation technique.
His work has been published in Management Science, Operations Research, Transportation Science, and the European Journal of Operational Research, among other notable journals.
